# AipWeek4Prep

## What you need

You will need:
- MySQL
- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
- angular-cli: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli

## Before you start

Make sure you have MySQL running on port `3306`. If you would like to recreate the database, run `DROP DATABASE aip_movies;` then serve the project.

## How to run

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run  `node server.js` to serve the project, typically at http://localhost:3000.

While developing, it's recommended to use `nodemon` (https://nodemon.io/). After installing, run `nodemon server.js` instead of `node server.js`. Happy days :)
