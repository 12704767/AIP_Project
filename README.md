## How to run

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run  `node server.js` to serve the project, typically to `localhost:3000`.

While developing, it's recommended to use `nodemon` (https://nodemon.io/). After installing, run `nodemon server.js` instead of `node server.js`. Happy days :)
